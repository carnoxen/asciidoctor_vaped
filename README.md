# AsciidoctorVaped

I vibed this project inspired by [Asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org). It has a long history,
but I can't read lots of if-else statements. So, I made this.
It is still in development. Be careful to use.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add asciidoctor_vaped
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```bash
gem install asciidoctor_vaped
```

## Usage

```sh
# just print a html file from adoc file.
asciidoctor_vaped demo.adoc

# this can accept a text.
asciidoctor_vaped -s 'hello *world*'

# or print something different like docbook.
asciidoctor_vaped demo.adoc demo.dkb
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
